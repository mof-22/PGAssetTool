/// #16 faces walked 353 GameObjects and their parents and took 270ms; with the bundle already
/// unpacked it took 13ms, and resolving a weapon went from about 110ms to about 10.

/// What it costs is memory: the bundle's full unpacked size for as long as the reader lives. The
/// prefab bundles run 10 to 30MB unpacked, and the one every weapon's arms come from is 54MB; d_c_f is
/// 216MB. So BundleSet unpacks only while a budget lasts, and reads the rest from disk as before.
