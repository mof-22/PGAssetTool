/// port that manages about 28MB/s. A game with thirty mods on it means rebuilding 180MB of bundles,
/// and nearly all of that was this one call: 17.9 of 19 seconds, measured across every bundle the
/// author's installation has.
///
/// The same bytes through a compressor written for speed take 0.9 seconds, at the same level and
/// for the same output size, because LZ4's 128KB blocks are independent and there are as many of
/// them as there are cores. So the compressing is done here and only the layout is borrowed.
///
/// The layout borrowed is exactly what AssetsTools.NET wrote: blocks of 128KB, the block and
/// directory table compressed and placed at the end, the file data starting at the offset the
/// header itself says it does. That shape is not the one the game ships — the shipped bundles keep
/// their table at the front, padded — and it is the one this tool has been writing into the game
/// all along, so it is the shape known to work.
