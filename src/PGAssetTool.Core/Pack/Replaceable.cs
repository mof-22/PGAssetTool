/// showing. A type gains an entry only once its import path works end to end — listing one earlier
/// would produce packs that fail when applied.
///
/// Nothing else goes back. An asset's raw serialized bytes (`.dat`) once did, for any class, along with
/// assets added to a bundle; the user retired both until there is a design worth rebuilding them on. A
/// pack is pictures, models and sounds, and nothing in it has to understand a class it cannot open.
