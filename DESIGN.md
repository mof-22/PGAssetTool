# How PGAssetTool works

This is the reasoning behind the tool, for anyone changing it. If you only want to use it, the
[README](README.md) is the whole of what you need.

Everything here is written because it was not obvious, or because it was got wrong once. The code
carries the same explanations at the things they explain; this is the shape they make together.

## What makes a game's item hard to find

An item's parts are spread across hundreds of bundles. One weapon's model, materials, icon, skins,
effects and display name each live somewhere different, and they are joined by three different
mechanisms rather than one:

| Link | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Binary `PPtr` references | `Material` → `Texture2D` |
| String paths resolved at runtime | a field holding `"Weapons/Weapon25"` |
| Naming convention | `Weapon687` ↔ `Ray687` |

Following only `PPtr` references leaves the tree disconnected: the model appears without its icon,
the skins without their materials. The tool follows all three, which is why a weapon comes out whole.

The same three joins hold for the game's other items. A hat has a prefab, an offer icon, related
assets and skins exactly as a weapon does; it is found by a string id where a weapon is found by a
number. Only the finding differs, which is why the code that walks and writes knows nothing about
weapons at all.

---

## The three layers

**Reading and writing assets** knows nothing about the game. `BundleSet`, `ReferenceWalker`,
`AssetExporter`, `AssetAddress`, `PackOperation`, `PackBuilder`, `PackFile`, `ModApplier`,
`ModStore`, the importers — all of it addresses a container, a class, a name and a path id. Nothing
in it has a concept of a weapon.

**The catalogues** are the part that is game-shaped: `ItemCatalog` reads the weapon registry,
`SkinCatalog` assembles skins from three bundles, `AssetLookup` maps asset paths to the bundles
holding them, `IconResolver` finds the one picture that stands for an item. This layer answers
"what exists, and where".

**The shell** — the GUI and the CLI — puts the two together.

Adding another kind of item is work in the middle layer. The layers below and above it already do
what they would need to do.

---

## Addressing an asset

A pack has to name assets in somebody else's installation, where path ids are not stable across
game versions. `AssetAddress` is therefore a container, a class, a name and an ordinal, with the
path id recorded as a preference rather than as the address.

Applying resolves the address in the player's own bundles. The path id is tried first, because it
makes a pack match what its author tested; when it names the wrong thing or nothing at all, the
name and class find it instead.

`AssetNaming` exists because a `Shader` keeps its name in `m_ParsedForm` rather than at the top of
the object. Every shader in the game has an empty `m_Name`, so anything reading the obvious field
finds nothing.

---

## What can be written back

Two levels, deliberately kept apart.

| Operation | Source | Applies to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `replaceTexture` | `.png` | `Texture2D` |
| `replaceMesh` | `.glb` | `Mesh` |
| `replaceAudio` | `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.ogg` | `AudioClip` |
| `replaceRaw` | `.dat` | any class |
| `addAsset` | `.dat` | any class the bundle already describes |

The first three take a file anybody can edit in an ordinary tool. `Replaceable` is the single
registry of those, and a class earns a place in it only once the import path works end to end —
listing one earlier produces packs that fail when applied.

`replaceRaw` is a level below: it writes an asset's own serialized bytes back without understanding
the class. That is how a `Material`, a `Font`, a `Transform` or a `Shader` gets changed at all. It
is not in `Replaceable`, and the distinction is load-bearing: it stops "a `Material` can be
replaced" coming to mean "a `Material` can be edited here", which it cannot.

`addAsset` is the same write into a path id nothing is using.

### Textures come out masked to what the model shows

A weapon's texture is an atlas with a great deal of nothing in it, and which island the model reads
is written in its UVs and nowhere an image editor can see. `UvCoverage` rasterises the triangles into
the texture's own grid, and the export clears the rest — 2,561 of #16's 4,096 texels, and 1,824 of
the 2,048 in the player atlas its arms read from.

The mask is cut exactly to the triangles, because the game reads exactly what it draws: 347 of the
367 textures in the bundle holding the weapons' art are point-filtered with no mip chain, so nothing
is sampled that a triangle does not land on. `UvCoverage.MarginFor` reaches one texel further for the
handful that are filtered or mipped. A flat two-texel margin — the first guess — claimed 65% of #16's
atlas where its model reads 37%, and the difference is visible against the same UVs opened in
Blender.

The alpha channel carries that mask outright rather than the original's. It has to: most of these
textures keep emission there rather than coverage, and `Map_Beretta_A` is 99.8% transparent before
anything is done to it, so a masked export that kept the original alpha would be as invisible as the
one it came from. The colours outside the mask are left exactly as they were, so nothing is painted
over and nothing is lost.

What the game had in that channel is not lost either. The operation records `AlphaIsMask`, and
applying one of those keeps the alpha already in the game — the same promise `--opaque` makes, by
the same route. Whoever drops that flag puts out the lights on every emissive part of every masked
texture, and nothing else would say so.

A texture no model here draws is written whole: a shop icon, a gloss or mask map bound beside the
main slot, a particle sheet. Clearing those would mean guessing which mesh reads them.

A texel is kept once a triangle covers a hundredth of it, and nothing more is asked. A texel a
triangle only clips looks from Blender like one that does not belong, but how much of it is covered
says nothing about whether the game draws it: a sliver of UV stretched over a large face lands on a
great many pixels. Cleared one at a time and rendered from sixty angles, 55 of #64's 60 thinnest kept
texels were drawn, and #416 has one covered 1.9% that lands on nearly forty thousand pixels — while
texels covered 18% turned up that nothing draws at all. No threshold separates the two.
### A model plays its own animations

The game's weapons are one skinned mesh on three or four bones — the slide, the magazine, the hands —
and their clips are legacy curves bound to those bones by the path from whatever carries the
Animation component. So a reload can be shown without a scene and without a second mesh: `Motion`
reads the curves, `Skeleton` walks the hierarchy from the renderer's `m_Bones`, and the vertices
follow. Twelve of twelve weapons sampled animate, along with half the capes, most gliders and half
the pets; hats, masks and boots are rigid and have no bones at all, and avatars are on bones whose
clips are not in their own prefab.

Three things about it that look arbitrary:

- **The space comes from the model at rest, not from the renderer's transform.** A bind pose is
  written against whatever the model was parented to when it was rigged, and the prefab no longer
  says what that was — the beretta's bind poses put its bones at the origin where its prefab hangs
  them a metre and a half away. At rest every bone's skinning matrix is the same one, so its inverse
  is by construction the transform that leaves the mesh where it was read.
- **A missing weight channel means one bone at full weight, not no bones.** These weapons are rigged
  one bone per vertex, so Unity writes no weights at all; reading that as zero left every vertex
  where it started, which looks exactly like an animation that does nothing.
- **The view is framed by the model at rest.** A pistol with its magazine out is a taller model than
  the same pistol at rest, and a frame sized to the moment slides about for the length of the clip.

### A workspace records what each model is drawn with

`PackOperation.Wears` names, for each `.glb`, the pictures beside it that go on it. A workspace holds
a model and a folder of images and nothing that pairs them, and the pairing cannot be recovered
afterwards by asking the game:

- More than one renderer draws the same mesh, and they disagree. The tactical knife's geometry is
  drawn by its own prefab in one paint and by a skin's prefab in another, both in `ecw_8`; #64's
  mesh answers with #62's texture. The weapon tree picks the renderer inside the weapon's own prefab
  closure, which is the one that is right.
- A workspace made from a skin does not agree with the game at all. The geometry is the weapon's, so
  the renderer names the weapon's paint — and the only pictures in the workspace are the skin's.

So the answer is written down at the one moment that knows it. Where several accounts are possible,
the export keeps the one whose textures it actually wrote out. Asking the game is still the fallback
for a workspace that says nothing, which is what `convert` produces.

### The one thing that is neither

Components, and the scripts that say which component they are, are neither shown nor written.

They are how the game decides what a thing *does*. This is a tool for how things look and sound, and
behaviour is a different question with different consequences: it reaches other players, where a
texture does not.

Not writing them is enforced at converting, at building and at applying. Applying is the one that
holds — a pack built by something else never went past the other two and arrives anyway.

Not *showing* them is a separate and weaker decision, made deliberately and worth being honest
about: anything that opens the bundles shows the same thing, and this makes no claim to prevent
that. What it buys is that the tool is not where somebody first meets the idea. References are still
followed *through* them, so a texture or a sound a component names is found exactly as before.

Nothing else in the tool is hidden, and nothing else should be. This is the exception, not a habit.

### Why the entry point is `.dat` and not source

Building a `Shader` from `.shader` source would mean reimplementing Unity's shader compiler:
ShaderLab parsing, `UnityCG.cginc`, HLSL to DXBC, the constant-buffer reflection tables, and Unity's
own blob container. Driving an installed Unity in batch mode would work and was offered.

Importing an asset out of a Unity-built `.assetbundle` needs almost no new code, because `BundleSet`
already reads one. That is the route to take if authoring in Unity ever becomes the answer.

---

## Adding an asset the game has not got

An asset that is not in the game yet has no path id anyone can rely on. The one it was built with is
recorded and tried first, but nothing reserves that number in the player's bundle and a game update
can put a real asset there.

So the identity is a handle the pack chooses — `newId` — and anything pointing at the new asset
records *where* the pointer is rather than what it holds:

```json
{ "op": "addAsset",
  "target": { "container": "ecw_34", "class": "Shader", "name": "font_color_fix",
              "pathId": -2415237287598442480 },
  "source": "font_color_fix.dat",
  "newId": "font_color_fix" },

{ "op": "replaceRaw",
  "target": { "container": "ecw_34", "class": "Material", "name": "debugger_20_26_map_font" },
  "source": "debugger_20_26_map_font.dat",
  "pointers": [ { "path": "m_Shader", "newId": "font_color_fix" } ] }
```

Applying hands out an id and fills in every pointer naming it. `PointerPath` is what makes that
possible: it records a position inside an asset rather than a value.

A pack that would need something this cannot promise is refused with a reason rather than made to
fit — no type information for the class in that bundle, a payload left behind in a stream, a
reference to a file the bundle does not list, or a name another asset of that class already has.

---

## Importing a mod made in another tool

`convert` takes the `.dat` files an asset editor writes — named `<asset>-CAB-<hash>-<pathId>.dat` —
and turns them into a workspace.

A `.dat` carries no type of its own, so the class is recovered from the asset it came from. When the
game has no asset at that path id, the mod is *adding* one, and the class is worked out from the
bytes instead: `ClassInference` parses them through each type the bundle describes and keeps the one
that writes back byte for byte.

The pointers that need repointing are found rather than declared. The author's own files already
point at the new asset by whatever id their editor gave it, so every pointer holding one of those
numbers is one that has to be rewritten.

---

## What a pack is

A `.pgmod` is a zip holding a manifest, the files it references, and the pack's picture.

Built with protection on it is a small container instead: a readable header saying who built it, and
the same zip with a keystream over it. The header stays readable so the manager can say where a pack
came from without unpacking it, and because a file that gives no account of itself is worse than one
that does.

The scrambling stops a pack being renamed to `.zip` and opened. It stops nothing else — this
repository says exactly how to undo it — and is not meant to. What it is for is that somebody's work
is not casually lifted out of the file they published.

`PackFile` is the one place that layout is written down. Do not duplicate it anywhere else, tests
included; that has already been wrong once.

### Signing

Signing says the contents are what the holder of that key put in, so a pack altered afterwards shows
up as altered. The author's name in the header is signed along with them, length-prefixed ahead of
the payload, so it cannot be moved onto somebody else's work or off your own without the key.

A name that is not signed is only a label. An earlier shape signed the contents alone, and a genuine
pack could be relabelled and go on reading as genuinely signed — by the genuine key, with the
genuine fingerprint printed beside somebody else's name.

Signing a pack again under a different key is not prevented, because it cannot be. What it costs is
the fingerprint, which is the part worth checking: the name is what somebody typed, the fingerprint
is what they hold. The fingerprint is taken over the key as the framework re-exports it rather than
over the bytes as they arrived: `ImportSubjectPublicKeyInfo` stops at the end of the structure, so a
padded key verified exactly as before under a fingerprint of the padder's choosing.

A seal is read before a pack from outside is installed, not when somebody looks at the row
afterwards, and a seal that will not decode is `Invalid` rather than `Unsigned`. Those are two
different statements and folding them together let an alteration erase the evidence of itself: break
the signature badly enough and the pack read as an ordinary unsigned zip. Installing an altered pack
is still allowed — a pack is a description of changes and whoever holds one may install it — but the
GUI asks first and the CLI wants `--force`.

### What a pack may not do

Two rules that exist because a manifest is data, and a workspace is a folder that gets shared:

- **Every path stays inside the workspace.** `PackBuilder.Inside` resolves the icon and every
  operation's source and refuses anything absolute, drive-relative, or reaching out through `..`.
  Without it, a manifest could name any file the builder could read and it went into the pack under
  whatever name the manifest gave it. The file that made this worth fixing is `author.key`.
- **Nothing is decompressed without a ceiling.** A zip states each entry's length and then hands
  over as many bytes as it likes, so the size that counts is the one coming out — `ReadEntry` and
  `WriteEntry` count as they go. `PackFile.Most` caps the file before it is read at all, because the
  manager reads every pack it lists in order to draw its picture.

---

## What a pack is for

A pack records the item it was made from — the kind, the thing, and which of its looks:

```
weapon/0416_ultimatum/nuclear_reactor
hat/league1_hat_hitman/default
```

Nothing about applying a pack reads it. A mod is its operations, and this is the label on the box.
It exists because the operations name assets and bundles, and no amount of reading them back says
"the nuclear reactor skin of #416" — so a pack that does not carry it cannot be filed, and filing by
guessing would file some of them wrong.

It is written at extraction, which is the only moment anything knows.

The record is deliberately not weapon-shaped, though weapons are the only kind extraction makes
today. Naming the parts generally cost nothing when it was done and saves moving every installed
pack and every folder on disk later.

The names are recorded *and* their translation keys are. The two answer different questions: the
name is what it was called when the pack was made, which a pack handed to somebody has to be able to
say for itself; the key is what it is called now, in whatever language the tool is set to. The
manager prefers to look the thing up by number or by skin id, which also reaches packs built before
any of this existed.

### Identity

Each extraction mints its own id — a readable half saying what it is for, and eight characters that
make it this one.

The id was the item's slug and nothing else, which made every mod of a weapon the same mod:
installing a skin replaced the plain one, and installing somebody else's replaced yours. Quietly,
and reasonably, because replacing by id is exactly how a mod is updated.

The id is written into the workspace once and never changes, so rebuilding the same workspace still
updates the mod it built before — the one case where replacing was meant. A second extraction of the
same thing gets its own workspace directory too, numbering up past any that already holds a
manifest.

---

## Installing

Applying, toggling and removing all work the same way: restore every affected bundle from its
backup, then reapply everything enabled, in the order it was installed.

That is why turning one mod off cannot undo another that shares a bundle, and why nothing stacks.
`ModApplier.Reconcile` restores from every backup but skips bundles already pristine.

A bundle is backed up before it is first written to, filed under its own hash so a backup taken
before a game update stays distinguishable from the version that replaced it. The backups are the
record of what has actually been written to — the installed list cannot answer that, because
uninstalling drops the mod before its bundles are put back.

`apply` refuses a bundle that something else has already modified and has no backup, unless `--force`
says to accept its contents as the original.

A reconcile is organised by bundle rather than by mod: every enabled mod's operations for one bundle
are gathered first, and the bundle is opened, edited and written once. Going mod by mod meant
rebuilding a bundle once per mod on it, and a rebuild is a decompress and a recompress — thirty-one
mods on seventeen bundles took thirty-eight seconds for forty operations.

Bundles that already hold what this run would put into them are left where they are. `written.json`
records, per bundle, the mods and packs it was built from and the hash of the file that came out; a
bundle whose recipe is unchanged and whose file still hashes to what was written is neither restored
nor rebuilt. Both halves have to hold, and anything else — a game update, an edit from outside, a
record from a run that did not finish — falls through to restoring and reapplying. `ModApplier.Rebuild`
turns the shortcut off, which is what the manager's *Reapply everything* is for. Turning one mod off
then costs the bundles that mod is on rather than every bundle any mod is on.

The ones that are rebuilt are rebuilt side by side, four at a time, largest first. They share
nothing: different files, different backups, their own corner of the staging directory. The limit is
memory rather than cores — a bundle holds its whole decompressed self while it is worked on, and the
largest in this game is 216MB — and each one already spreads its compression across every core.
A pack is opened once for the whole run and read under a lock, because several bundles may be drawing
from it at the same time.

Writing one back out is `BundlePacker`, not the library's `Pack`. AssetsTools.NET's LZ4 is LZ4HC
through a managed port that manages about 28MB/s, and it was seventeen of those nineteen remaining
seconds; the blocks are independent, so they are compressed here, on every core. `BundlePacking`
chooses between the size the game ships and about four times the speed for about a sixth more disk.
The layout written is the one AssetsTools.NET wrote — 128KB blocks, the block and directory table
compressed at the end — which is not the layout the game ships and is the one this tool has always
written into it. Each bundle is rebuilt beside the file it replaces and renamed over it, so the last
step is a rename rather than a copy across drives.

### Where things are kept

Everything the tool writes lives in `PGAssetTool-data/`, beside the executable. No registry, no
`%APPDATA%`. Inside a checkout it resolves to the repository root, so every build shares one store.

```
PGAssetTool-data/
  settings.json          preferences
  author.key             the key packs are signed with
  mods/<kind>/<item>/<look>/   packs kept so a mod can be reinstalled without its workspace
  workspace/             extracted and converted workspaces
  installs/<game>/
    backup/              each bundle as it was before the first write to it
    installed.json       the ledger
    written.json         what was last written into each bundle, so a reconcile can skip it
```

The arrangement under `mods/` is the one the manager shows. Two views of the same thing that
disagree are worse than either.

---

## Things that look arbitrary and are not

**`BundleSet` opens each bundle once.** Asking twice leaves a handle that disposing does not close,
and the next write to that bundle fails with the file in use.

**`MeshRenderer` keeps the larger Z** in its depth test: forward points at the viewer.
**Screen-right is the negative of the frame's own right axis**, applied after the roll — the viewer
stands on the far side of the model from Unity's own camera, so what that camera has on its right is
on their left. Getting this wrong draws every model mirrored, which is invisible on a gun and
obvious the moment a texture has writing on it.

**The camera holds one rotation, not a yaw, a pitch and a roll.** It held three angles for a long
time and that made it a turntable: sideways turned the model about one axis of its own whatever the
picture was tilted to, so a tilted view dragged about an axis that no longer looked vertical, and
the pitch had to stop at the poles because past them a drag to the right walked the viewer left.
Every one of those is a property of keeping the rotation as three numbers in a fixed order. The
turntable, an arcball and a trackball were built side by side and driven against the same models,
and the trackball was kept: a drag turns the model about the axis lying across it on the screen, so
there is no axis of the model to become unstable and no pole to collapse at. What it gives up is a
level horizon — the named views are how a model is put back square. `Camera.Facing` still takes a
yaw, a pitch and a roll, built through the old frame so every angle written down means what it did.

**A drag's turn goes on the left of the rotation, with its axis turned over in y and z.** On the
left because a drag is a movement of the picture, not of the model; turned over because the frame
is drawn mirrored in x, and conjugating a turn by that mirror is exactly the sign change. Without it
a drag downwards tips the model the wrong way and a tilt winds backwards.

**The pivot is a point of the model rather than an offset in the frame**, so panning something into
view and then turning keeps it in view.

**The preview opens tilted.** The default camera is the angle the game draws its own `icon1_big`
shop pictures at — muzzle up and to the right, nearly side-on — so an author meets the shape they
already know. It was measured, not chosen: fitting silhouettes to the icons stalled at about 0.8
because the icons carry a drawn outline, so 55 weapons were matched by hand and read back against
each candidate frame. Against the faced bounding box the 39 that fire agree to within 5 degrees;
blades scatter over 35 around the same middle, which is no convention rather than a second one.

**A pack's picture is framed from the model's vertices, not from a drawing of it.** A drawing is
clipped at the frame, so a model three times too wide reads as one that fits exactly.

**Which end a weapon's barrel is on comes from the prefab, not from the model's shape.** The
bounding box says which side is longest and nothing about which end is which, so half the weapons
opened pointing left. Guessing from the geometry does not work: four signals measured against 157
weapons labelled by hand all read the same thing — that one end carries more of the model — and the
best, counting vertices, called 74.5%. The prefab knows outright: `GunFlash`, `BulletSpawnPoint` and
`Point_Arm_Left` are where the muzzle and the hand are, and the first of them present is right for
150 of the 151 weapons it answers for. `Facing` turns the model a half circle about the vertical
when the muzzle would be on the left — a half circle and not a mirror, or every texture with writing
on it reads backwards — and decides which end is which along the long axis only, because the other
two axes swing into the answer as the opening angle changes.

**`FsbAdpcm`** decodes the game's ADPCM here because Fmod5Sharp does not saturate the predictor. The
container layout was read off the data; it is not documented anywhere reachable.

**Each preview pane remembers a view per model**, and the two panes of a comparison hand theirs to
each other only once both are filled. Mirroring mid-load writes one model's angle into another's
memory.

**A pack's protection and picture are saved the moment they are chosen; its text waits for Save.**
A three-state checkbox turned protection off on its first click, and only Save made anything stick.
And because any write to a workspace makes the editor read it again, a re-read keeps text typed and
not yet saved rather than refilling the form from disk, which it used to do without a word.
---

## Verifying a change

```
dotnet test -c Release
dotnet run --project src/PGAssetTool.Gui -c Release -- --self-test
```

`dotnet test` needs no game and is what CI runs.

**`--self-test` is the real check.** It drives the view models against the live installation:
resolves weapons, decodes previews, rasterises, builds the real window and reads back what landed in
it, then extracts, edits, packs, installs, toggles and removes for real. Most of the bugs in this
codebase were found by it, or by a check added to it. Prefer adding a check there over reasoning
about whether something works.

Two things about it that must stay true:

- **It writes to the game.** It refuses to start if the game is running, records what was installed
  before it began, and removes only its own packs.
- **It leaves the author's things alone** — their installed mods, their workspaces, their
  `settings.json`. It uses its own temp workspace and its own settings home, and asserts at the end
  that the real settings file is byte-identical.

Two traps when adding to it:

- Avalonia headless decodes every `Bitmap` to 1×1. Measure images from their bytes
  (`StbImageSharp.ImageInfo`), and measure layout from `Bounds` after an explicit `Measure`/`Arrange`
  — a binding that resolves to nothing leaves the view model perfectly correct.
- The self-test keeps the dispatcher as its synchronization context and pumps it in `WaitWhile`.
  Clearing it puts continuations on the pool, where the first one to touch a bound collection throws
  "call from invalid thread" a long way from the cause.
